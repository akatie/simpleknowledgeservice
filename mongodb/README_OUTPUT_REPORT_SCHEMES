	-------------- details --------------
	Definition:
		RxNorm, a standardized nomenclature for clinical drugs, is produced by the National Library of Medicine. In this context, a clinical drug is a pharmaceutical product given to (or taken by) a patient with a therapeutic or diagnostic intent. In RxNorm, the name of a clinical drug combines its ingredients, strengths, and form. However; some important medicines are not sufficiently or appropriately characterized by those three components alone. These have been identified as medicines that are dispensed in 'Packs'. The RxNorm clinical drug name does not indicate the form in which the product was manufactured, or its form when it arrived at the dispensary.
