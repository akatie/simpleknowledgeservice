Represent medical knowledge schemes like RxNORM, SNOMED and LOINC in standard [SKOS](http://www.w3.org/TR/skos-primer/), add in [JSON-LD](http://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld/), the data-model aware flavor of JSON, take either open source Fuseki/Jena or MongoDB and you have what you need for a service to represent, compare and reason over medical knowledge.
