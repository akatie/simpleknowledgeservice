# simpleknowledgeservice
all you need for a simple medical knowledge service. Not a simplistic knowledge service or a service for simplistic knowledge but a straightforward, consistent service for medical knowledge.

>> In every field of inquiry, it is true that all things should be made as simple as possible â€“ but no simpler. (And for every problem that is muddled by over-complexity, a dozen are muddled by over-simplifying.)

In-between excel spreadsheets and crude lookup tables and the lofty towers of ontologies and orders of logic lies a middle ground where knowledge can be
represented consistently, compared, translated, measured and reasoned upon with a minimum of frills and theory.
