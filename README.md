# Simple Schemes Service (TripleS)
all you need for a simple medical knowledge service. Not a simplistic knowledge service or a service for simplistic knowledge but a straightforward, consistent service for medical knowledge.

>> In every field of inquiry, it is true that all things should be made as simple as possible – but no simpler.

In-between excel spreadsheets and crude lookup tables and the lofty towers of ontologies and orders of logic lies a middle ground where knowledge can be
represented consistently, compared, translated, measured and reasoned upon with a minimum of frills and theory.

Not going beyond Knowledge Schemes to other forms of meta data, to data models or elaborate document templates.

Take the scheme graphs produced by kGrafer and produce a knowledge service in two flavors, one based on a JSON-document store MongoDB and the other a RDF-backed graph store.
