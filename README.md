# Simple (Medical) Knowledge Service

Represent medical knowledge schemes such as RxNORM, SNOMED and LOINC in standard [SKOS](http://www.w3.org/TR/skos-primer/), add in [JSON-LD](http://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld/), the graph-aware flavor of JSON, and either open source Fuseki/Jena or MongoDB and you have what you need for a service to represent, compare and reason over medical knowledge.

To get started, just git clone this repository and follow the instructions for either a Fuseki/Jena or MongoDB based service. 

__Eating our own__: we host an SKS at [schemes.caregraf.info](http://schemes.caregraf.info).
